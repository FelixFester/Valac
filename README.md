Yotsuba-  Modern php 8.3.8 imageboard in one simple file. 

I only make very simple things with PHP- because anything complicated should be made with Rust or Go. Nevertheless, this simple php script is a gem. It is currently all into one file, super easy to feed to chatgpt and tell it what you want changed. For production use, simply tell chat gpt to make CSRF tokens and make sure input is properly sanitized for security. I only f/w the latest verssion of php. Anything older is just stupid. So do not expect this to work on earlier versions. 

This script is a versatile and user-friendly message board designed for writing and sharing posts, such as chess articles, with rich media support. It features a clean and responsive layout, making it easy to read and navigate on various devices. The message board has a light grey background to reduce eye strain, while the form for creating new posts is initially hidden and can be toggled with a [NEW POST] button. Once the form is opened, an [X] button allows users to close the form. The form itself is centered on the page for a better user experience and includes fields for a title, a message, and an optional media upload. The title field has a maximum length of 20 characters, and the message field can contain up to 100,000 characters. Users can upload images in JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP formats, or videos in WEBM and MP4 formats.

When a user submits a new post, the form data is sent to the server via AJAX, ensuring the page does not need to be refreshed. This provides a seamless user experience. The script handles the form submission by storing the post data in an SQLite3 database and saving any uploaded media files in a designated 'uploads' directory. If a file with the same name already exists, the script automatically appends a number to the filename to ensure uniqueness and prevent overwriting. After successfully submitting a post, the new content is dynamically added to the top of the list of posts.

Each post is displayed with a grey background to distinguish individual entries. The layout ensures that the title appears as a heading beneath any media content, and the message text is displayed below the title. Images are initially displayed with a width of 200 pixels and maintain their aspect ratio. Clicking on an image expands it to the full width of the post area, with a maximum width of 100%, ensuring the entire image is visible and scaled appropriately. This functionality is achieved using CSS and JavaScript, which handle the toggle effect for expanding and contracting the images.

Additionally, the script includes a responsive design that ensures the message board uses most of the screen width while maintaining a small margin for better aesthetics. This design choice ensures that the content is easily readable on devices of various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops. The combination of PHP, SQLite3, jQuery, and AJAX provides a robust backend for handling form submissions, media uploads, and data storage, while ensuring a smooth and interactive front-end user experience.

This script is ideal for creating a community-driven platform where users can share detailed articles and posts enriched with multimedia content, making it perfect for applications like chess articles, where users might want to include annotated images and videos. The intuitive interface and seamless interactions ensure that users can focus on creating and sharing content without being bogged down by technical complexities.
